# PDF-Merger
My attempt at creating a pdf merger in Python so that I can add engineering sheets to my hw files

Basic Operations:

- Hit run and select the files you want to be merged together
- the code will merge files in order of selection
- the merged file will appear in the same folder as the FIRST selected document
	with the same filename+'-merged' after it
- to end the loop simply not slect a file or close the dialog box
